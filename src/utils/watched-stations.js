/**
 * Resolves which stations a worker should bin-watch trigger, by reading the
 * calling worker's own .orchestrator/ files directly (the same files
 * `fob-orc lines/stations pull` keep in sync with the orchestrator).
 *
 * A line owns the worker location (orchestrator D3): `.orchestrator/lines/*.json`
 * carries `{ code, location }`, and every station file names its line by code.
 * A station is "at this location" when its line's location equals
 * `process.env.WORKER_LOCATION`. A single worker repo may hold lines at several
 * locations, and a worker process only ever executes tasks for its own — so it
 * must not bin-watch-trigger stations meant for a different one.
 *
 * Eligibility to be watched is `watch_enabled === true` on the station itself —
 * a real orchestrator-side column (Stations.watch_enabled), not a hardcoded list.
 * Step 0 decides which watcher serves it: a `move_files` conveyor is
 * bin-watched (resolveWatchedStations), a line-head with a `watch_path` is
 * intake-watched (resolveIntakeWatchedStations).
